            <p>
              I've made my home base in Pittsfield, NH, with my family.
              My journey into tech began with a few college courses at a local community college.  As I started coding my first website,
              I was fascinated with how HTML and CSS just made sense to me.  From then on I have been learning all I can through coding and reading blogs.
              I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="half-width">
            <p>
              That curiosity then opened the door that could never be shut.  When I learned how to build my
              first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility I was looking for in work.
              Now I've made a full swith to front-end development, where I can use my organizational skills and eye
              for detail to write clean, elegant code.

            <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
            <p>
              My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the
              content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.

            <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
            <p>
              I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on.  I focus on keeping my
              CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.

            <h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>
            <p>
            You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly & accurately converting it into a
            webpage that is a pixel-perfect match.
